# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)

We found that the code 'strcpy(t->filename, filename)' would cause a buffer
overflow, because if we were to have a filename that was larger than FILENAMESIZ,
we would overwrite the filename buffer. To fix this problem, we decided to use 
strncopy instead of strcpy. Since strncopy has an extra paramater where we could
specify the size, we could restrict the filename size to FILENAMESIZ. 

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)

1. We found that the peers can send endless data when it receives a request from a peer.
We added a maximum file size to stop downloading at and restarting the file session.
The current limit is set at ~1GB and is adjustable in the #define section at the
beginning of the file.

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)

# Extra credit problems
#Extra credit problem: none

# Add any other information you'd like us to know below this line.
