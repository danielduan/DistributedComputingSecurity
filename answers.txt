# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)

We decided to use the fork() function to parallelize our peer download and
uploads. We would use fork() to spawn a new child thread for each download/upload
that we had. This allowed us to parallize because each child would be able to perform
the download or upload while the parent would be able to spawn more children for other files. 

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)

We found that the code 'strcpy(t->filename, filename)' would cause a buffer
overflow, because if we were to have a filename that was the same length or
larger than FILENAMESIZ, we would overwrite the filename buffer. To fix this 
problem, we decided to use strncopy instead of strcpy. Since strncopy has an 
extra paramater where we could specify the size, we could restrict the filename 
size to FILENAMESIZ. 

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)

1. We found that the peers can send endless data when it receives a request from a peer.
We added a maximum file size to stop downloading at and restarting the file session.
The current limit is set at ~1GB and is adjustable in the #define section at the
beginning of the file.

2. We found that the task buffer would fill up before actual file transfer is completed.
Instead of dynamically resizing, we decided on an optimal number of 52800. 

3. We fixed a problem with an attacker possibly trying to access directories that
aren't the current directory. We did this by checking the filename, and if the filename
had a '/' character, then we knew it was trying to access some other directory. Therefore,
we would report an error if that would happen and exit. 

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)

# Extra credit problems
#Extra credit problem: none
